# Mapping_Earthquakes.

# Introduction

This project was created for the purpose of visual presentation of  the differences in the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

# Resources
* HTML
* Javascript
* D3
* Leaflet
* geoJSON

# Results
1. First we added layers of all earthquakes and tectonic plates to our map using geoJSON data. The red lines in the map show us where we have tectonic plates.

2. Next we included the major earthquale data in the past week and set the radius to be reflective of the magnitude of the earthquake.

# Summary

In this project we can clearly depict the locations with the highest and lowest magnitudes of the eathquakes.
